# Disclaimers

This is "useful knowledge for around the house".

Use your own judgment.


## Safety Tips

* Slip knots
* Your hands are important to you
* Carabiners


## Rope Strength

* Breaking strength / working load / design factor
    * 5:1 (for stuff) to 12:1 (for humans)
    * Knots
    * Sun / water / dirt / abrasion
* "Doubling" a line
* Perpendicular force


## Knot security

* Slippery ropes
* Intermittent loads
* Mis-tied knots
* Wrong knot


# Rope


## Cordage

* Cordage
    * Twine (thinnest)
    * Cord (thin)
    * Rope (thicker)
* Line


## Rope-like materials

* Webbing (strap)
* Monofilament


## There is no perfect rope

* Strength
* Thickness
* Weight
* Price
* Slipperiness
* Stretchiness
* Resistances (UV, water, abrasion)
* Feel in the hand
* Appearance
* Electrical conductivity


# Choosing a rope


## First, choose the material

* Natural (plant) fibers
    * Manila, hemp, sisal, jute, cotton, ...
* Synthetic
    * Polypropylene
    * Nylon
    * Polyester
    * Kevlar, Dyneema, Spectra, other branded materials
    * Combinations of synthetics


### Natural fibers

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; secure knots; strong when wet | Weak (relatively); rot; fray when cut | Cheap & weak (twine); thick & human use (rope railing, rope bridge, tug of war); decoration |


### Polypropylene ("good")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Water- and electrical-resistant; floats; cheap | Slippery; stretchy; stretches permanently; NOT UV-resistant | Swimming pools; boating |


### Nylon ("better")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; strong; somewhat stretchy; abrasion- and UV-resistant | Somewhat stretchy; weakens (15%) in water; recoils when snapped under tension | Good all-around rope |


### Polyester ("best")

Similar to nylon, but:

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Keeps strength when wet; better abrasion- and UV-resistance; not as stretchy | Not as stretchy; not quite as strong; costs more | Long-term outdoor use; abrasion protection; when you need rope that doesn't stretch (as much) |

Not worth the extra cost, if you don't need it


## Then, choose how it's made

* Fibers ➜  strands (yarns) ➜  twisted / woven

* Twisting / weaving determines:
    * Strength
    * Stretch
    * Splice-ability
    * Unraveling
    * Shape
    * Cost


### Decisions, decisions

* Twisted (cheap, annoying, easy to splice)
* Braided
    * Diamond (splice-able, annoying)
        * Without a core (less expensive, flattens)
        * With a core (stronger, round)
    * Solid (smooth, tough, hard to splice, won't unravel)
        * Without a core (strong)
        * With a core (depends on the core)


### "Double braid"

* A braided rope with another braided rope inside it!
* Inner for strength, outer for protection (usually)
* Strongest
* "Kernmantle" and "arborist" ropes
* "Paracord"


## Then, choose a thickness

* Thicker is stronger
    * and heavier
    * and expensiver
    * and thicker

## Terminology

<img src="http://howtowilderness.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/RopeTermsLabeled.jpg" />

(And hundreds more...)


## Grog Knots

* It's a game-changer to have a reference in your pocket
    * [animatedknots.com](http://www.animatedknots.com) (ads)
    * [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animated-knots-by-grog/id376302649?mt=8) ($5)
    * [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animatedknots.knots&hl=en) ($5)
    * [Windows app](http://www.animatedknots.com/purchasewin.php)?!? ($5)


## Why are there so many knots?

* Strength vs. first-to-fail
* Security vs. quick adjustments
* Stable loading vs. jerks vs. intermittent loads
* Rope texture / slipperiness / flexibility
* Have to be (un)tied while under load
* Have to be (un)tied quickly
* Water, sun, wind
* Rope storage


## How many knots are there?

* [Ashley Book of Knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots)
    * About 3,800
    * Published in 1944
    * The definitive reference, still today
    * Maybe a few-dozen new ones documented, since then
* You don't need to know them all!


## But which ones should I know?

1. Consider the problem(s) you need to solve
2. Consider how hard the knot is to remember
3. Consider how likely the knot is to do what you want


# Let's practice!

<h3 class="fragment">(You'll need some rope!)</h3>


## Problem: fraying rope ends

* Memorable: melt the ends, or tape
* In a pinch: [Figure 8](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8_/index.php)
    * Also a decent "stopper" knot
    * Also the basis for a bunch of other knots
* Quality: [Common Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/commonwhipping/index.php)
* Best: [Sailmaker's Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/sailmakers/index.php)


## Problem: coiling rope

* Memorable: [Figure-8 coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php#figure8coil) (on the arm)
* Traditional: [Gasket coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php) ("over / under")
* Cool: [Chain sinnet](http://www.animatedknots.com/chainsinnet/index.php) (doubled)


## Problem: attach rope to a bar

"Hitch"

* Memorable: [Lark's Head / Cow Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/cowloop/index.php), but tied like a [Girth Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/girth/index.php)
    * Only in the middle of the rope!
* Reliable: [Round Turn and 2 Half Hitches](http://www.animatedknots.com/roundturn/index.php)
    * Or really, "Round Turn (or two) and 2 (or more) Half Hitches"
* Cool: [Icicle Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/icicleend/index.php)
* Cool but risky: [Tumble Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/tumble/index.php)


## Problem: tighten a load (or tent)

Use a [ratchet strap](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Tie-Down-Straps-Bungee-Cords/N-5yc1vZc2dnZ12kx/Ntk-all/Ntt-ratchet%2Bstraps?NCNI-5)!

* Memorable: [Midshipman's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans/index.php)
    * Sidebar: Boy Scouts and the Taut Line Hitch
* Cool: [Trucker's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/index.php)
    * Memorable: [a song about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUHgGK-tImY)


## Problem: join two ropes (or ends)

* Memorable (but prone to fail): [(Single) Fisherman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_knot)
* Better, but harder to get right: [Double Fisherman's](http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermans/index.php)
* Won't bind: [Zeppelin Bend](http://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin/index.php)


## Problem: loop that won't pull tight

* Memorable: [Figure 8 Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8follow/index.php#Figure8Loop)
* Can tie around an object: [Bowline](http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/index.php)
    * Secure the working end!
    * Lots of variations for particular situations
    * Pronunciation
* Reliable (and fun): [Double Dragon Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/doubledragon/index.php)
    * (Hard to tie around an object)


## Problem: loop in middle of line

* Memorable and reliable, using the line: [Alpine Butterfly Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2aRj8dQPRQ)
    * [Grog's way](http://www.animatedknots.com/alpinebutterfly/index.php) is harder to remember
    * [Traditional way](https://www.wikihow.com/Tie-an-Alpine-Butterfly-Knot) is maybe easy to remember but is harder to do
* Memorable and reliable, if you have a separate loop of cord: [Prusik](http://www.animatedknots.com/prusik/index.php)
