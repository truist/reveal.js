# Disclaimers

This is "useful knowledge for around the house".

Use your own judgment.


## Safety Tips

* Slip knots

* Your hands are important to you

* Carabiners


## Rope Strength

* Breaking strength / working load / design factor

    * 5:1 (for stuff) to 15:1 (for humans)

    * Knots

    * Sun / water / dirt / abrasion

* "Doubling" a line

* Perpendicular force


# Rope


## Cordage

* Cordage

    * Twine (thinnest)

    * Cord (thin)

    * Rope (thicker)

* Line


## Rope-like materials

* Webbing (strap)

* Monofilament


## There is no perfect rope

* Strength
* Thickness
* Weight
* Price
* Slipperiness
* Stretchiness
* Resistances (UV, water, abrasion)
* Feel in the hand
* Appearance
* Electrical conductivity


# Choosing a rope


## First, choose the material

* Natural (plant) fibers

    * Manila, hemp, sisal, jute, cotton, ...

* Synthetic

    * Polypropylene

    * Nylon

    * Polyester

    * Kevlar, Dyneema, Spectra, other branded materials

    * Combinations of synthetics


### Natural fibers

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; secure knots; strong when wet | Weak (relatively); rot; fray when cut | Cheap & weak (twine); thick & human use (rope railing, rope bridge, tug of war); decoration |


### Polypropylene ("good")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Water- and electrical-resistant; floats; cheap | Slippery; stretchy; stretches permanently; NOT UV-resistant | Swimming pools; boating |


### Nylon ("better")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; strong; somewhat stretchy; abrasion- and UV-resistant | Somewhat stretchy; weakens (15%) in water; recoils when snapped under tension | Good all-around rope |


### Polyester ("best")

Similar to nylon, but:

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Keeps strength when wet; better abrasion- and UV-resistance; not as stretchy | Not as stretchy; not quite as strong; costs more | Long-term outdoor use; abrasion protection; when you need rope that doesn't stretch (as much) |

Not worth the extra cost, if you don't need it


## Then, choose how it's made

Fibers ➜ strands (yarns) ➜ twisted / braided

* Twisting / braided determines:
    * Strength
    * Stretch
    * Splice-ability
    * Unraveling
    * Shape
    * Cost


### "Double braid"

* A braided rope with another braided rope inside it!

* Inner for strength, outer for protection (usually)

* Strongest

* "Kernmantle" and "arborist" ropes

* "[Paracord](http://www.ramblinjim.com/articles/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-paracord/)"


## Then, choose a thickness

* Thicker is stronger

    * and heavier

    * and expensiver

    * and thicker

# Knots

<h3 class="fragment">(Finally!)</h3>


## Terminology

<img src="http://howtowilderness.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/RopeTermsLabeled.jpg" />

(And hundreds more...)


## Grog Knots

* It's a game-changer to have a reference in your pocket

    * [animatedknots.com](http://www.animatedknots.com) (ads)

    * [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animated-knots-by-grog/id376302649?mt=8) ($5)

    * [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animatedknots.knots&hl=en) ($5)

    * [Windows app](http://www.animatedknots.com/purchasewin.php)?!? ($5)


## How many knots are there?

* [Ashley Book of Knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots)

    * About 3,800

    * Published in 1944

    * The definitive reference, still today

    * Maybe a few-dozen new ones documented, since then

* You don't need to know them all!


## But which ones should I know?

1. Consider the problem(s) you need to solve

2. Consider how hard the knot is to remember

3. Consider how likely the knot is to do what you want


# Let's learn some knots!

<h3 class="fragment">(You'll need some rope!)</h3>


## Problem: fraying rope ends

* Memorable: melt the ends, or tape

* In a pinch: [Figure 8](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8_/index.php)

    * Also a decent "stopper" knot

    * Also the basis for a bunch of other knots

* Quality: [Common Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/commonwhipping/index.php)

* Best: [Sailmaker's Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/sailmakers/index.php)


## Problem: coiling rope

* Memorable: [Figure-8 coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php#figure8coil) (on the arm)

* Traditional: [Gasket coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php) ("over / under")

* Cool: [Chain sinnet](http://www.animatedknots.com/chainsinnet/index.php) (doubled)


## Problem: attach rope to a bar

"Hitch"

* Memorable: [Lark's Head / Cow Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/cowloop/index.php), but tied like a [Girth Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/girth/index.php)

    * Only in the middle of the rope!

    * Not double-strength!

* Reliable: [Round Turn and 2 Half Hitches](http://www.animatedknots.com/roundturn/index.php)

    * Or really, "Round Turn (or two) and 2 (or more) Half Hitches"

* Cool: [Icicle Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/icicleend/index.php)

* Cool but risky: [Tumble Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/tumble/index.php)


## Problem: join two ropes (or ends)

* Memorable (but prone to fail): [(Single) Fisherman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_knot)

* Better, but harder to get right: [Double Fisherman's](http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermans/index.php)

* Won't bind: [Zeppelin Bend](http://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin/index.php)


## Problem: loop that won't pull tight

* Memorable: [Figure 8 Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8follow/index.php#Figure8Loop)

* Most famous: [Bowline](http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/index.php)

    * Can be easily tied around an object

    * Not perfect, but a good balance of constraints

    * Pronunciation

* Reliable (and fun): [Double Dragon Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/doubledragon/index.php)

    * (Hard to tie around an object)


## Problem: tighten a load (or tent)

Use a [ratchet strap](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Tie-Down-Straps-Bungee-Cords/N-5yc1vZc2dnZ12kx/Ntk-all/Ntt-ratchet%2Bstraps?NCNI-5)!

* Memorable: [Midshipman's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans/index.php)

    * (Boy Scouts teach the Taut Line Hitch, which isn't as good)

* Stronger: [Trucker's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/index.php)

    * Cooler: [a song about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUHgGK-tImY)


## Problem: loop in middle of line

* Using the line itself: [Alpine Butterfly Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2aRj8dQPRQ)

    * [Grog's way](http://www.animatedknots.com/alpinebutterfly/index.php) is harder to remember

    * [Traditional way](https://www.wikihow.com/Tie-an-Alpine-Butterfly-Knot) is harder to do

* Using a separate loop of cord: [Prusik](http://www.animatedknots.com/prusik/index.php)


## Footnotes

* [Shoelaces](http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/11/shoe-string-theory-science-shows-why-shoelaces-come-untied/) are a worst-case scenario, for knots

* [Knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory) - Math!

* [Lashings](https://bit.ly/2MgGuf3) - Build things!

* The necktie uses a slightly-modified [buntline hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/buntline/index.php)
