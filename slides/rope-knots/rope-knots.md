# Disclaimers

I knew a lot about knots. I learned a lot about rope, to prepare for this.

This is "useful knowledge for around the house".

Use your own judgment.


## Safety Tips

* Slip knots

* Your hands are important to you

* Carabiners


## Rope Strength

* Breaking strength / working load / design factor

    * 5:1 (for stuff) to 15:1 (for humans)

    * Knots

    * Sun / water / dirt / abrasion

* "Doubling" a line

* Perpendicular force


## Before we get started...

Please start preparing rope pieces


# Rope


## Cordage

* Cordage

    * Twine (thinnest)

    * Cord (thin)

    * Rope (thicker)

* Line


## Rope-like materials

* Webbing (strap)

* Monofilament (fishing line)

* Shock cord (bungee cord)


## There is no perfect rope

* Strength
* Thickness
* Weight
* Price
* Slipperiness
* Stretchiness
* Resistances (UV, water, abrasion)
* Feel in the hand
* Appearance
* Electrical conductivity


# Choosing a rope


## First, choose the material

* Natural (plant) fibers

    * Manila, hemp, sisal, jute, cotton, ...

* Synthetic

    * Polypropylene

    * Nylon

    * Polyester

    * Kevlar, Dyneema, Spectra, other branded materials

    * Combinations of synthetics


### Natural fibers

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; secure knots; strong when wet | Weak (relatively); rot; fray when cut | Cheap & weak (twine); thick & human use (rope railing, rope bridge, tug of war); decoration |


### Polypropylene ("good")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Water- and electrical-resistant; floats; cheap | Slippery; stretchy; stretches permanently; NOT UV-resistant | Swimming pools; boating |


### Nylon ("better")

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheap; strong; somewhat stretchy; abrasion- and UV-resistant | Somewhat stretchy; weakens (15%) in water; recoils when snapped under tension | Good all-around rope |


### Polyester ("best")

Similar to nylon, but:

| Upsides | Downsides | Good Uses |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Keeps strength when wet; better abrasion- and UV-resistance; not as stretchy | Not as stretchy; not quite as strong; costs more | Long-term outdoor use; abrasion protection; when you need rope that doesn't stretch (as much) |

Not worth the extra cost, if you don't need it


## Then, choose how it's made

Fibers ➜ strands (yarns) ➜ twisted / braided

* Twisting / braided determines:
    * Strength
    * Stretch
    * Splice-ability
    * Unraveling
    * Shape
    * Cost


### "Double braid"

* A braided rope with another braided rope inside it!

* Inner for strength, outer for protection (usually)

* Strongest

* "Kernmantle" and "arborist" ropes

* "[Paracord](http://www.ramblinjim.com/articles/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-paracord/)"


## Then, choose a thickness

* Thicker is stronger

    * and heavier

    * and expensiver

    * and thicker

## Where to buy

* Locally: [REI](https://www.rei.com/stores/cleveland.html) (or online)

* Online: [Knot & Rope Supply](https://www.knotandrope.com/store/pc/home.asp)

* Avoid: Home Depot, Amazon


# Knots

<h3 class="fragment">(Finally!)</h3>


## Terminology

<img src="http://howtowilderness.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/RopeTermsLabeled.jpg" />

(And hundreds more...)


## Grog Knots

* It's a game-changer to have a reference in your pocket

    * [animatedknots.com](http://www.animatedknots.com) (ads)

    * [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animated-knots-by-grog/id376302649?mt=8) ($5)

    * [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animatedknots.knots&hl=en) ($5)

    * [Windows app](http://www.animatedknots.com/purchasewin.php)?!? ($5)


## How many knots are there?

* [Ashley Book of Knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots) ("ABOK")

    * About 3,800

    * Published in 1944

    * The definitive reference, still today

    * Maybe a few-dozen new ones documented, since then

* You don't need to know them all!


## But which ones should I know?

1. Consider the problem(s) you need to solve

2. Consider how hard the knot is to remember

3. Consider how (un)likely the knot is to be annoying

4. Consider how likely the knot is to fail disastrously


# Let's learn some knots!

<h3 class="fragment">(You'll need some rope!)</h3>


## Fraying rope ends

* Memorable: melt the ends, or tape

* In a pinch: [Figure 8](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8_/index.php)

    * Also a decent "stopper" knot

    * Also the basis for a bunch of other knots

* Quality: [Common Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/commonwhipping/index.php)

* Best: [Sailmaker's Whipping](http://www.animatedknots.com/sailmakers/index.php)


## Coiling rope

* Memorable: [Figure-8 coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php#figure8coil) (on the arm)

* Cool: [Chain sinnet](http://www.animatedknots.com/chainsinnet/index.php) (doubled)

* Best: [Gasket coil](http://www.animatedknots.com/coiling/index.php) ("over / under")


## Attach ("hitch") rope to a bar

* Memorable: [Lark's Head / Cow Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/cowloop/index.php), but tied like a [Girth Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/girth/index.php)

    * Only in the middle of the rope!

    * Not double-strength!

* Reliable: [Round Turn and 2 Half Hitches](http://www.animatedknots.com/roundturn/index.php)

    * Or really, "Round Turn (or two) and 2 (or more) Half Hitches"

* Cool: [Icicle Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/icicleend/index.php)

* Cool but risky: [Tumble Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/tumble/index.php)


## Join two ropes (or ends)

* Memorable, but prone to fail or bind: [(Single) Fisherman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_knot)

* Better, but harder to get right: [Double Fisherman's](http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermans/index.php)

* Won't bind: [Zeppelin Bend](http://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin/index.php)


## Tighten a load (or tent)

* Memorable: [Midshipman's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans/index.php)

    * (Boy Scouts teach the Taut Line Hitch, which isn't as good)

* Stronger: [Trucker's Hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/index.php)

    * Cooler: [a song about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUHgGK-tImY)

<br>
<p class="fragment">Use a [ratchet strap](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Tie-Down-Straps-Bungee-Cords/N-5yc1vZc2dnZ12kx/Ntk-all/Ntt-ratchet%2Bstraps?NCNI-5)!</p>


## Loop in middle of a line

* Using the line itself:

    * Memorable, once learned: [Directional Figure 8 Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8directional/index.php)

    * Cool and more general: [Alpine Butterfly Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2aRj8dQPRQ)

        * [Grog's way](http://www.animatedknots.com/alpinebutterfly/index.php) is harder to remember

        * [Traditional way](https://www.wikihow.com/Tie-an-Alpine-Butterfly-Knot) is harder to do

* Using a separate loop of cord: [Prusik](http://www.animatedknots.com/prusik/index.php)


## Loop that won't pull tight

* Memorable: [Figure 8 Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8follow/index.php#Figure8Loop)

* Most famous: [Bowline](http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/index.php)

    * Can be easily tied around an object

    * Not perfect, but a good balance of constraints

    * Pronunciation

* Reliable (and fun): [Double Dragon Loop](http://www.animatedknots.com/doubledragon/index.php)

    * Hard to tie around an object


## Odds and ends

* Clotheslines are a special problem (strong, soft, won't sag, won't rust, cheap): [Cotton over polyester](https://www.homedepot.com/p/T-W-Evans-Cordage-7-32-in-x-100-ft-Evandale-Cotton-Clothesline-Hank-43-070/205326942) ($0.11/ft)

* [Hammocks, too](https://www.whoopieslings.com)

* [Shoelaces](http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/11/shoe-string-theory-science-shows-why-shoelaces-come-untied/) are a worst-case scenario, for knots

* [Knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory) - Math!

* [Lashings](https://bit.ly/2MgGuf3) - Build things!

* The necktie uses a slightly-modified [buntline hitch](http://www.animatedknots.com/buntline/index.php)

* Given an unknown rope, it might have [identifying markings](https://www.tensiontech.com/tools-guides/rope-colour-markings)

* High-end ropes are measured in [kiloNewtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) - roughly 1kN per person
