Use your own judgment.


## Safety Tips

* Slip knots
* Your hands are important to you
* Carabiners


## Rope Strength

* Breaking strength / working load / design factor
    * 5:1 (for stuff) to 12:1 (for humans)
    * Knots
    * Sun / water / dirt / abrasion
* "Doubling" a line
* Perpendicular force


## Knot security

* Slippery ropes
* Intermittent loads
* Mis-tied knots
* Wrong knot


# Rope


## Cordage

* Cordage
    * Twine (thinnest)
    * Cord (thin)
    * Rope (thicker)
* Line


## Rope-like materials

* Webbing (strap)
* Monofilament


## There is no perfect rope

* Strength
* Thickness
* Weight
* Price
* Slipperiness
* Stretchiness
* Resistances (UV, water, abrasion)
* Feel in the hand
* Appearance
* Electrical conductivity


# Choosing a rope


## First, choose the material

* Natural (plant) fibers
    * Manila, hemp, sisal, jute, cotton, ...
* Synthetic
    * Polypropylene
    * Nylon
    * Polyester
    * Kevlar, Dyneema, Spectra, other branded materials
    * Combinations of synthetics


### Natural fibers

* Cheap
* Weak (relatively)
* Secure knots
* Absorb moisture
    * Keep their strength
    * Rot
* Fray when cut
* Great for:
    * Cheap & weak (twine)
    * Thick & human use (rope bridge, tug of war)
    * Decoration


### Polypropylene ("good")

* Water- and electrical-resistant
* Floats
* Cheapest
* What you'll find most easily at Home Depot
* Not great for knots
* Stretches permanently
* NOT UV-resistant
    * Unless infused with UV-absorbing chemicals
        * Which they often are... without telling you


### Nylon ("better")

* Cheap
* Strong
* Somewhat stretchy
* Abrasion- and UV-resistant
* Weakens (15%) in water
* Recoils when snapped under tension
* Good all-around rope


### Polyester ("best")

* Similar to nylon, but:
    * Keeps strength when wet
    * Better abrasion- and UV-resistance
    * Not as stretchy (good and bad)
    * Not quite as strong
    * Costs more
* Great for ropes that shouldn't stretch, long-term outdoor use, abrasion protection
* Not worth the extra cost, otherwise


## Then, choose how it's made

* Fibers ➜  strands (yarns) ➜  twisted / woven
* Twisting / weaving determines:
    * Strength
    * Stretch
    * Splice-ability
    * Unraveling
    * Shape
    * Cost


### Decisions, decisions

* Twisted (cheap, annoying, easy to splice)
* Braided
    * Diamond (splice-able, annoying)
        * Without a core (less expensive, flattens)
        * With a core (stronger, round)
    * Solid (smooth, tough, hard to splice, won't unravel)
        * Without a core (strong)
        * With a core (depends on the core)


### "Double braid"

* A braided rope with another braided rope inside it!
* Inner for strength, outer for protection (usually)
* Strongest
* "Kernmantle" and "arborist" ropes
* "Paracord"


## Then, choose a thickness

* Thicker is stronger
    * and heavier
    * and expensiver
    * and thicker

# Knots

## Terminology

INSERT PICTURE FROM BOOK


## Grog Knots

* It's a big game-changer to have a handy reference
    * [animatedknots.com](http://www.animatedknots.com)
    * [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/animated-knots-by-grog/id376302649?mt=8) ($5)
    * [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animatedknots.knots&hl=en) ($5)
    * [Windows app](http://www.animatedknots.com/purchasewin.php) (huh???) ($5)


## Why are there so many knots?

* Strength vs. first-to-fail
* Security vs. quick adjustments
* Stable loading vs. jerks vs. intermittent loads
* Rope texture / slipperiness / flexibility
* Have to be (un)tied while under load
* Have to be (un)tied quickly
* Water, sun, wind
* Rope storage


## How many knots are there?

* [Ashley Book of Knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots)
    * About 3,800
    * Published in 1944
    * The definitive reference, still today
    * Maybe a few-dozen new ones documented, since then
* You don't need to know them all!


## But which ones should I know?

1. Consider the problem(s) you need to solve
2. Consider how hard the knot is to remember
3. Consider how likely the knot is to do what you want


# Let's practice!

<h3 class="fragment">(You'll need some rope!)</h3>


## Problem: coiling rope

* Memorable: Figure-8 coil (on the arm)
* Reliable: Gasket coil ("over / under")
* Cool: Chain sinnet


## Problem: fraying rope ends

* Memorable: melt the ends, or tape
* In a pinch: Figure 8
    * Also a decent "stopper" knot
    * Also the basis for a bunch of other knots


## Problem: attach rope to a bar

"Hitch"

* Memorable: Lark's Head / Cow Hitch
    * Only in the middle!
* Reliable: Round Turn and 2 Half Hitches
* Cool: Icicle Hitch
* Cool but risky: Tumble Hitch


## Problem: tighten a load (or tent)

Use a ratchet strap!

* Memorable: Midshipman's Hitch
    * Sidebar: Boy Scouts
* Cool: Trucker's Hitch
    * Memorable: a song about it


## Problem: join two ropes (or ends)

* Memorable: Double Fisherman's
    * Memorable but dangerous: (Single) Fisherman's
* Won't bind: Zeppelin Bend


## Problem: loop that won't pull tight

* Memorable: Figure 8 Loop
* Can tie around an object: Bowline
    * Secure the working end!
* Reliable (and fun): Double Dragon Loop
    * (Hard to tie around an object)


## Problem: loop in middle of line

* Memorable and reliable, using the line: Alpine Butterfly Loop
* Memorable and reliable, if you have extra cordage: Prusik
