## What to teach?

* Understand electricity itself
    * Common concepts are massively misleading

* Check your house's safety
    * Help you understand what you have

* Practical knowledge / how-to
    * Help you make your life better

ü§î


## What's most interesting, to this audience?

I wasn't sure.

I surveyed a number of you.

I settled on...


## Today's agenda

* Why you should(n't) trust me
* Basic electrical concepts, briefly
* Understand electrical dangers
* Check your house!
* Demonstrate common electrical modifications
    * And how to stay safe while doing them!
* But wait, there's more!


## My qualifications

* Interest and experience since high school
    * Person-weeks upgrading home electrical circuits
    * Person-days researching core concepts

* Oh, you wanted formal education?
    * Electricity & Magnetism (physics) class in college
        * (Which isn't really relevant)

* Some of what I tell you today will probably be wrong
    * But WAY less-wrong than most stuff online

* I am not an electrician!


## USA only

* I only know about the United States
    * Most of it is also true in Canada
* All other continents are each very different from the US
    * Plugs & outlet design
    * Grounding systems
    * Operating voltage & frequency
    * Wire sizes & colors
    * Laws
    * Etc...


# PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK


# Basic electrical concepts, briefly


<img src="/img/ohms-law-illustrated.jpg" style="max-height: 700px;" />


## Watt about watts?

Amps * Volts = Watts

15A (typical circuit) * 120V (USA) = 1800W on a single circuit

One 15A (1800W) circuit can handle a max of:

* 1 area heater
* or 1 hair dryer
* or 2 small toasters
* or 30 60W light bulbs
* or 200 60W-equivalent LED bulbs


## Naming things

The people who named the things in the electrical domain were experts.

So the names are all weird and misleading.

If you're confused, it's not just you.

(For example: wire gauges, "14/2", grounding, current, "three-way switch", GFCI, CAFCI)



# Understand electrical dangers


## Danger: electricity

* Your body runs on electricity
    * Extra electricity (even a tiny bit) is not welcome!
    * Heart & brain can just stop working
    * Muscles can lock up
* It's the current **and** the voltage that kill you
    * Your skin is very electrically-resistant
        * Less so, wet
    * Your bloodstream, tongue, eyes are great conductors!
    * Static electricity vs. "mains" electricity
* Instantaneous consequences


## Danger: heat

* Flowing electricity generates heat
    * Much like friction - more electricity, smaller wires, more heat
    * An AA battery with a paperclip can cause intense burns
* The big risk is fire
    * But burning your lungs is bad, too!
* Slower consequences
    * There's time to react, if you're nearby when it happens
    * But the consequences might be delayed!


## Danger: water

* Fresh water is actually a bad conductor
    * But it's often connected to pipes which are grounded
    * And it lowers your skin's resistance
    * And spreads the connection over your body
        * Including e.g. your mouth, or cuts
* It's rather hard to breathe
    * E.g. if your muscles are locked up and your head is under
* Instantaneous consequences, usually


## Danger: lightning (1 of 3)

* Heat, electricity, and water!
* I used to not worry about lightning danger
    * Then I read about it!
* [5 ways lightning strikes people](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-struck)
    * *Nearby* lightning is dangerous!
        * Under trees is *more* dangerous!


## Danger: lightning (2 of 3)

* Basically:
    * [There is no safe place outside](https://www.weather.gov/media/safety/Lightning-Brochure18.pdf)
    * Inside, the metal paths-to-ground in your house [act as a shield](http://stormhighway.com/protection.php)
        * Plumbing, electrical
            * Which may melt and may set your house on fire
        * They will take most of the damage, so you don't
        * Nearby tall trees are more-likely to be hit first, which helps
    * Don't touch grounded stuff inside
        * Plumbing
        * Anything plugged in


## Danger: lightning (3 of 3)

* Odds of you getting hit by lightning, in a year: [about 1 in 1,000,000](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds)
* Odds of your house getting hit by lightning, in a year: about 1 in 1,000
    * [About 80M detached houses in the US](https://www.quora.com/How-many-houses-are-there-in-the-US?share=1)
    * [About 80K homeowners insurance claims per year for lightning](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-lightning)



## Practical fear

* Electricity is dangerous; it can kill you instantly
* But household electricity mostly won't
    * Your house has features designed to keep you safe
    * Your skin protects you, usually
    * US electricity (120V, 60Hz) won't lock your muscles, usually
    * Shocking your hand just hurts; it won't kill you
* You can work on it safely, with just a few rules


# Check your house


## Isn't it already safe?

* Maybe?
    * Many electricians are "experts who've done it that way for years"
    * Home inspectors only check the basics
    * Older work probably hasn't been updated to latest standards
    * Homeowner work üòâ

* National Electrical Code
    * Updated every 3 years
    * Adopted (as law) by localities... eventually
    * Enforced by electrical inspectors... when the work was done... if the work had a permit


## What type of wiring?

Look in your basement or attic, and check it against
[this (long) guide](https://inspectapedia.com/electric/Old_Electrical_Wiring.php)

* Modern ("Romex")
* Fabric-wrapped
* Aluminum
* Knob and Tube


## Wire type: Modern

* Romex (brand name, like Kleenex)
* NM (Non-Metallic)
* NMC (NM Cable)
* UF (Underground Feeder)
* üëç (assuming it was installed correctly)


## Wire type: Fabric-wrapped

* Predecessor to NM
* Common in older homes around here
* Might have asbestos, but probably not
* Old splices might not be in junction boxes
* Probably no ground wire
* Hard to modify without damage
* Tolerable


## Wire type: Aluminum

* 1965-1972
* Basically [a fire waiting to happen](https://www.alwirerepair.com/aluminum-wiring-whats-the-problem)
* Look for "AL" or "aluminum"
* (The main line into your house is aluminum; that's OK)
* Copper-Clad Aluminum (CCA) is fine!


## Wire type: Knob and tube

* Predecessor to fabric
* Spliced outside junction boxes
* No ground
* Unreliable polarity
* ***Might not*** be ***especially*** dangerous if:
    * It's never been altered or damaged
    * No additional wiring was added to it
    * No insulation was added around it
    * All outlets are two-prong-only or GFCI (better!)
    * You've never run any high-draw devices on it


## Let's check the actual wiring!

Just kidding. Too complicated. But there is a heuristic!

Does starting your toaster or window air conditioner dim your lights?

It might mean the wires are too thin and/or too long.

Or maybe the lights are "dimmable" LEDs reacting to voltage fluctuations.

Pet peeve: buried junction boxes are bad.

Any specific questions?


## Check the outlets

Three main types:

* GFCI üéâ
* 3-prong üëç
* 2-prong üòü


### Outlets: GFCI

* GFCI outlets (and/or breakers) protect humans from electrocution
    * Huh? Isn't that what all breakers do?
* One GFCI outlet provides protection for all *downstream* outlets
* They can wear out
    * Newer ones have lights
* "Nuisance trips" aren't, 99% of the time
* Test them!
    * For wiring correctness, too
    * And downstream outlets
    * Inspector should have done this
* These are life-critical anywhere there's water or earth/concrete
    * Kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors, basements, garages


### Outlets: 3-prong

* Check for physical damage
* Check the wiring (with a tester)
    * Inspector should have done this
* Variation: 20A outlets
    * A weird "T" slot
    * Sometimes wired into 15A circuits by homeowners
        * It won't actually provide 20A
            * (Unless the breaker fails!)
        * It's OK to do so, but weird


### Outlets: 2-prong

* No ground!
    * Those adapters put you in danger!
* Test the polarity
    * With a tester + adapter
* Best if these are protected with a GFCI upstream
    * Even if the GFCI isn't grounded!
        * Which protects humans, but surge protectors won't work right
    * And then you can replace these with 3-prong, for convenience
        * (They'll be safe, but they still aren't actually grounded)
        * This is allowed! (with stickers)


## Extension cords!

* Little ones can only handle 13A
    * But easily overloaded to whatever the overall circuit will handle (15A or 20A)
        * A single hair dryer will do it
    * Heat / fire!
        * But probably not
* Thicker cords (with thicker wires) are ***better***
    * Less resistance, so less heat generated
* Power/surge strips with breakers should protect themselves
    * But sometimes fail to do so


## Power surges

* Surges come from:
    * Neighborhood lightning
    * Power outages
    * Brownouts
    * Motors in your home (fridge, air conditioner, etc.)
* Surges happen in microseconds
    * You won't perceive them, unless they break something
* Surges cause heat, which causes damage to delicate electronics
    * Small surges cause small damage, and vice-versa
    * Damage accumulates over time


### Surge protectors

* Most surge protectors shunt the excess power to the neutral and/or ground wires
    * No ground wire, worse/no surge protection!
        * That's why there's a light!
* Surge protectors still "let-through" voltage
    * Typically ~330-400V
    * (For microseconds)
* Surge protectors won't block a direct lightning strike
    * But they *might* be enough for a nearby lightning strike
    * Ignore the "connected equipment insurance"
        * Homeowner's / renter's insurance probably covers it
* You need protection for internet and phone lines, too
    * For nearby lightning

#### Surge protectors wear out!

* "MOV"-based protectors
* Each surge alters the surge protector components
* Old surge protectors probably won't protect
* Quality surge protectors will shut off when worn out
    * Cheap ones are more proactive: they might catch fire!
    * The "protected" light isn't always reliable
* Thumb rule: 5 years. Or 3. Or 10. Or 2. Or after nearby lightning.
    * üò†


#### What surge protector to get?

* [Wirecutter's article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-surge-protector/) is *excellent*

* Or <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Surge_protector#/Series_mode_(SM)_surge_suppressors">Series Mode surge suppressors</a> are awesome!
    * And expensive!
        * But not so bad on Ebay!
    * And don't shunt to the ground wire!
    * And don't wear out!
    * And don't protect from surges on neutral and/or ground! üò¢
        * Which is a small risk, because lightning


#### Whole-house surge protection

* Consider [whole-house surge protection](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Siemens-20-Amp-6-5-in-Whole-House-Surge-Protected-Circuit-Breaker-QSA2020SPDP/202562776), too
* Your fridge, stove, washing machine, etc. are all computers
* ~$120 + an electrician
* Probably MOV-based
* I *think* they protect from surges on all lines
* Let-through ~600V, so you still need regular surge protectors
    * ...which won't wear out as fast
* Much better nearby-lightning protection
    * Still won't save you from direct lightning

Whole-house + Series Mode is pretty great üòÅ


## Check your breaker box

* Main breaker: 100A or 200A?
    * Is an electric car in your future?
* Most breakers: 20A or 15A?
* Big stuff (air conditioner, dryer, oven/stove): 30A
* Sub panels: 50A or more
* What type of breakers?
    * (C)AFCI? GFCI? AFCI + GFCI? "Regular"?
* (Mapping circuits)


### Breaker types: "regular"

* No lights or buttons
* Trip (disconnect power) if there is too much current draw
    * i.e. overloading and/or wiring faults (short circuits)
    * i.e. these protect against overheating
* The ground wire system works by *causing* over-current in case of a human-dangerous wiring fault inside the appliance, thereby tripping the breaker
    * This is the only case where regular breakers protect humans from electrocution
        * And if you defeat the grounding system with one of those adapters, you are removing this safety mechanism!
* Electrocuting yourself probably won't trip these!


### Breaker types: AFCI

* Typically labeled "CAFCI"
    * With a light and a test button
* Trip if their circuitry detects arcing / sparking
    * (And if there is over-current)
    * These protect against overheating (from overload) and overheating (from sparks)
        * These don't prevent electrocution, any better than regular breakers!
* These are required by code for nearly every circuit in modern builds
    * They cost $40+, vs. $5
    * They may be [pointless](http://www.combinationafci.com/resources/doc_ieee_combination_afci.pdf)
* If these do trip because of an arc, take it seriously!


### Breaker types: GFCI

* Just like a GFCI outlet, but in breaker form
* Usually a light and a test button
* Trip if there is more current going out than coming back
    * (And if there is over-current)
    * These protect against overheating *and* electrocution
* These will (usually) save you from electrocution!
* But GFCI breakers are usually worse than GFCI outlets
    * Farther away from the user, if they need reset
    * Very long wiring paths can cause false-trips
    * Less-likely to notice if they've worn out
* If these trip, and you're not sure why, take it seriously!


### Breaker types: AFCI + GFCI

* Not the same thing as "CAFCI"!
    * ("Combination AFCI" - doesn't mean GFCI!)
* Typically two lights and one button
* Protect from heat (overload) and heat (sparks) and electrocution (shocks)
    * All the things!
* $45+
* Maybe you want the GFCI part near the user
* Maybe CAFCI is pointless


## Last thing: wire sizes

* You don't really need to check this, but it's commonly misunderstood
    * And if you have homeowner-work in your house, they might have screwed it up üòâ
* The breaker amperage has to match the thinnest wire on the circuit
    * (Wires in the wall, not e.g. extension cords)
* 14 gauge wire = 15A breaker
* 12 gauge wire (thicker!) = 20A breaker

That's the rule.

You can have thicker wires on a lower-amperage breaker. Or 20A outlets on a 15A breaker. Just **don't** have 14ga wire on a 20A breaker!


# Safely working with household electricity


## Proceed at your own risk

### If you aren't comfortable, don't do it


## Safety precautions

* Turn off the power
    * Lock it off
    * Check it!
* Isolate yourself (from ground, and from hot)
    * Shoes
    * Plastic-handled tools
    * Gloves, maybe
* One-hand rule
* Don't work during a storm
* Pause and think


## Plan your work

* Open things up and see what's really in there
    * (After turning off the power!)
* Make note of space, outlet colors, existing wiring, etc.
* Consider whether you need a permit
    * Consider whether you are required to add smoke detector!
    * (Nothing we learn today should require either)
* Shop for parts


## Gather tools

* Outlet tester / voltage tester / multimeter
    * (Or known-working lamp)
* Wire cutter / stripper
    * (Or knife)
* Screwdrivers / power screwdriver (with plastic handles)
* Flashlight / headlamp
* Needle nose pliers (with plastic handles)
* Electrical tape

For bigger jobs:

* Wire
* Wire nuts / Wago nuts
* Extra bolts


## Get started

* Wear shoes
* Think through what you plan to do
* Gather your tools and supplies
* Turn off the power
    * Lock it out
    * Check that it's off


# Simple electrical improvements you can do

* Replace a plug end
* Upgrade or fix a lamp
* Replace a wall switch
* Replace a 2-prong or 3-prong outlet with a GFCI
* Replace a downstream 2-prong with 3-prong

(All things where you can just replace the part, without changing the circuitry)


## Replace a plug end

* Easy!
* Unplug it
* Cut the old one off
* Expose and strip the wires
* Underwriter's knot
* Wire it up
    * Be careful of polarity
* Test it


## Replace a lamp socket/switch

* Fix one that's fritzy
    * Could be the wiring or the socket
* Or convert to 3-way, or change the switch
    * Be careful about heat, if using incandescent bulbs
* (Show parts / options)
* Unplug it
* Take off the old one
    * Polarity usually doesn't matter
* Wire in the new one
    * Underwriter's knot
* Test it


## Replace a wall switch

* Shop
    * Quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
        * Neutral wire should not be connected
            * (Except in some 3-way scenarios)
    * Remove, replace (unchanged from original)
    * Wrap, reassemble
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test


## Replace a 2-prong or 3-prong outlet with a GFCI

* Shop
    * Amperage, depth, tamper, quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
    * Remove, replace
        * Be careful of "line" vs. "load"
    * Wrap, reassemble, sticker
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test

...then replace downstream 2-prong outlets with 3-prong


## Replace a downstream 2-prong with a 3-prong 

* Same as GFCI, but easier
* Shop
    * Amperage, tamper, quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
    * Remove, replace (unchanged from original)
    * Wrap, reassemble, (sticker)
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test


# But wait, there's more!

## Electricity is **very** misunderstood


## In a future session, we'll learn that:

* Your body is held together by electricity
* Electrical energy travels outside the wire
* Current does not flow
* Batteries do not store or generate electricity
* Electrons in a circuit move slowly (inches per hour)
* The (outdoor) air around your body has a large voltage (>100V)


## And we'll learn:

* The earth is a poor conductor
* Electricity does not naturally go to earth
* The hot wire is electrically dangerous *because of* grounding
* Bathtubs are electrically dangerous *because of* grounding
* The ground wire would be effective even if it wasn't connected to earth
* Your house does not have two-phase power


## By gaining an accurate (and simple) understanding of:

* What electricity really is
    * Fundamental forces, energy, voltage, current, resistance, etc.
* The design of the US electrical system
    * Especially "grounding"
* Alternating current, transformers, phases, and power factor


# TODO

images / more-interesting visuals
reference links
better context-keeping

-----------


## Then, choose a thickness

<!-- .slide: data-background="#AAA" -->

* Thicker is stronger

    * and heavier

    * and expensiver

    * and thicker
