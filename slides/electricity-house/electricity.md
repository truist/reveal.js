    * And how to stay safe while doing them!
* But wait, there's more!


## My qualifications

* Interest and experience since high school
    * Person-weeks modifying home electrical circuits
    * Person-days researching core concepts

* Oh, you wanted formal education?
    * Electricity & Magnetism (physics) class in college
        * (Which isn't really relevant)

* Some of what I tell you today will probably be wrong
    * But WAY less wrong than most stuff online


## USA only

* I only know about the United States
    * Most of it is also true in Canada
* Europe, Asia, and Africa are each very different from the US
    * Plugs & outlet design
    * Grounding systems

    * Etc...


# PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK


# Basic electrical concepts, briefly


<img src="/img/ohms-law-illustrated.jpg" style="max-height: 700px;" />


## Watt about watts?

Amps * Volts = Watts

15A (typical circuit) * 120V (USA) = 1800W on a single circuit

One 15A circuit can handle (one of):

* 30 60W light bulbs
* 200 equivalent LED bulbs
* 2 small toasters
* 1 hair dryer
* 1 area heater


# Household electrical dangers


## Danger: electricity

* Your body runs on electricity
    * If you add extra electricity, it might stop running!
    * Heart & brain can just stop working
    * Muscles can lock up
* It's the current **and** the voltage that kill you
    * Your skin is very electrically-resistant
        * Less so, wet
    * Your bloodstream, tongue, eyes are great conductors!
    * Static electricity vs. "mains" electricity
* Instantaneous consequences


## Danger: heat

* Flowing electricity generates heat
    * Much like friction - more electricity, smaller wires, more heat
    * An AA battery with a paperclip can seriously burn you
* The big risk is fire
    * But burning your lungs is bad, too!
* Slower consequences
    * There's time to react, if you're nearby when it happens
    * But the consequences might come well after the cause


## Danger: water

* Fresh water is actually a bad conductor
    * But it's often connected to pipes which are grounded
    * And it lowers your skin's resistance
    * And spreads the connection over your body
        * Including e.g. your mouth, or cuts
* It's rather hard to breathe
    * E.g. if your muscles are locked up and your head is under
* Instantaneous consequences, usually


## Danger: lightning

* Heat, electricity, and water!
* I used to not worry about lightning danger
    * [5 ways lightning strikes people](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-struck)
        * *Nearby* lightning is dangerous!
            * Under trees is *more* dangerous!
* Basically:
    * [There is no safe place outside](https://www.weather.gov/media/safety/Lightning-Brochure18.pdf)
    * Inside, the metal paths-to-ground in your house [act as a shield](http://stormhighway.com/protection.php)
        * Plumbing, electrical
            * Which may melt and may set your house on fire
        * They will take most of the damage, so you don't
        * Nearby tall trees are more-likely to be hit first, which helps
    * Don't touch grounded stuff inside
        * Plumbing
        * Anything plugged in
* Odds of you getting hit by lightning, in a year: [about 1 in 1,000,000](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds)
* Odds of your house getting hit by lightning, in a year: about 1 in 1,000
    * [About 80M detached houses in the US](https://www.quora.com/How-many-houses-are-there-in-the-US?share=1)
    * [About 80K homeowners insurance claims per year for lightning](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-lightning)



## Practical fear

* Electricity is dangerous; it can kill you instantly
* But household electricity mostly won't
    * Your house has features designed to keep you safe
    * Your skin protects you, usually
    * US electricity (120V, 60Hz) won't lock your muscles, usually
    * Shocking your hand just hurts; it won't kill you
* You can work on it safely, with just a few rules


# Check your house


## Isn't it already safe?

* Maybe?
    * Many electricians are "experts who've done it that way for years"
    * Home inspectors only check the basics
    * Older work probably hasn't been updated to latest standards
* National Electrical Code
    * Updated every 3 years
    * Adopted (as law) by localities... eventually
    * Enforced by electrical inspectors... when the work was done... if the work had a permit


## What type of wiring?

Look in your basement or attic, and check it against
[this (long) guide](https://inspectapedia.com/electric/Old_Electrical_Wiring.php)


## Wire type: Modern

* Romex (brand name, like Kleenex)
* NM (Non-Metallic)
* NMC (NM Cable)
* UF (Underground Feeder)
* 👍


## Wire type: Fabric-wrapped

* Predecessor to NM
* Common in older homes around here
* Might have asbestos, but probably not
* Old splices might not be in junction boxes
* Probably no ground wire
* Hard to modify without damage
* Probably acceptable


## Wire type: Aluminum

* 1965-1972
* Basically [a fire waiting to happen](https://www.alwirerepair.com/aluminum-wiring-whats-the-problem)
* Look for "AL" or "aluminum"
* (The main line into your house is aluminum; that's OK)
* Copper-Clad Aluminum (CCA) is fine!


## Wire type: Knob and tube

* Predecessor to fabric
* Spliced outside junction boxes
* No ground
* Unreliable polarity
* ***Might not*** be especially dangerous if:
    * It's never been altered or damaged
    * No additional wiring was added to it
    * No insulation was added around it
    * All outlets are two-prong-only or GFCI (better!)
    * You've never run any high-draw devices on it


## Let's check the actual wiring!

Just kidding. Too complicated. But there is a heuristic!

Does starting your toaster or window air conditioner dim your lights?

It might mean the wires are too thin / too long.

Or maybe the lights are "dimmable" LEDs reacting to voltage fluctuations.

Pet peeve: buried junction boxes are bad.

Any specific questions?


## Check the outlets

Three main types:

* GFCI 🎉
* 3-prong 👍
* 2-prong 😟


## Outlets: GFCI

* GFCI outlets (and/or breakers) protect humans from electrocution
    * Huh? Don't they all?
* One GFCI outlet provides protection for all *downstream* outlets
* They can wear out
    * Newer ones have lights
* "Nuisance trips" aren't, 99% of the time
* Test them!
    * For wiring correctness, too
    * And downstream outlets
    * Inspector should have done this
* These are life-critical anywhere there's water or earth/concrete
    * Kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors, basements, garages


## Outlets: 3-prong

* Check for physical damage
* Check the wiring (with a tester)
    * Inspector should have done this
* Variation: 20A outlets
    * A weird "T" slot
    * Sometimes wired into 15A circuits by homeowners
        * It won't actually provide 20A
            * (Unless the breaker fails!)
        * It's OK to do so, but weird


## Outlets: 2-prong

* No ground!
    * Those adapters put you in danger!
* Test the polarity
    * With a tester + adapter
* Best if these are protected with a GFCI upstream
    * Even if the GFCI isn't grounded!
        * Which protects humans, but surge protectors won't work right
    * And then you can replace these with 3-prong, for convenience
        * (They'll be safe, but they still aren't actually grounded)
        * This is allowed! (with stickers)


## Extension cords!

* Little ones can only handle 13A
    * But easily overloaded to whatever the overall circuit will handle (15A or 20A)
        * A single hair dryer will do it
    * Heat / fire!
        * But probably not
* Thicker cords are ***better***
    * Less resistance, so less heat generated
* Power/surge strips with breakers should protect themselves
    * But sometimes fail to do so


## Power surges

* Surges come from:
    * Neighborhood lightning
    * Power outages
    * Brownouts
    * Motors in your home (fridge, air conditioner, etc.)
* Surges happen in milliseconds
    * You won't perceive them, unless they break something
* Surges cause heat, which causes damage to delicate electronics
    * Small surges cause small damage, and vice-versa
    * Damage accumulates over time


## Surge protectors

* Most surge protectors shunt the excess power to the neutral and/or ground wires
    * No ground wire, worse/no surge protection!
        * That's why there's a light!
* Surge protectors still "let-through" voltage
    * Typically ~330-400V
* Surge protectors won't block a direct lightning strike
    * But they *might* be enough for a nearby lightning strike
    * Ignore the "connected equipment insurance"
        * Homeowner's / renter's insurance probably covers it
* Surges wear out most surge protectors
    * Old surge protectors probably won't protect
    * Quality surge protectors will shut off when worn out
        * Cheap ones are more proactive; they might catch fire!
    * Thumb rule: 5 years. Or 3. Or 10. Or 2. Or after nearby lightning.


## What surge protector to get?

* [Wirecutter's article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-surge-protector/) is *excellent*
* [Series Mode surge suppressors](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Surge_protector#/Series_mode_(SM)_surge_suppressors) are awesome!
    * And expensive!
        * But not so bad on Ebay!
    * Don't rely on the ground wire
    * Don't wear out
    * Don't protect from surges on neutral and/or ground
        * Which is a very small risk, because lightning
* Consider [whole-house surge protection](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Siemens-20-Amp-6-5-in-Whole-House-Surge-Protected-Circuit-Breaker-QSA2020SPDP/202562776), too
    * Your fridge, stove, washing machine, etc. are all computers
    * Expensive to install
    * Watch out for MOV-based ones!
    * Let-through ~600V, so you still need regular surge protectors
        * ...which won't wear out as fast
    * Much better nearby-lightning protection
        * Still won't save you from direct lightning



# But wait, there's more!

## Electricity is **very** misunderstood


## In a future session, we'll learn that:

* Your body is held together by electricity
* Electrical energy travels outside the wire
* "Current" does not "flow"
* Batteries do not store or generate electricity
* Electrons in a circuit move slowly (inches per hour)
* The (outdoor) air around your body has a large voltage (>100V)


## And we'll learn:

* The earth is a poor conductor
* Electricity does not naturally go to ground
* The "hot" wire is electrically dangerous *because of* grounding
    * Ditto for bathtubs
* The ground wire would be effective even if it wasn't connected to earth
* Your house does not have two-phase power


## By gaining an accurate (and simple) understanding of:

* What electricity really is
    * Fundamental forces, energy, voltage, current, resistance, etc.
* The design of the US electrical system
    * Especially "grounding"
* Alternating current, transformers, phases, and power factor

## Then, choose a thickness

<!-- .slide: data-background="#AAA" -->

* Thicker is stronger

    * and heavier

    * and expensiver

    * and thicker
