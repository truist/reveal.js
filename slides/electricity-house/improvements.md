HOW TO REPLACE A SWITCH
	https://www.buildmyowncabin.com/electrical/wire-3-way-switches.html




# Simple electrical improvements you can do

* Replace a plug end
* Upgrade or fix a lamp
* Replace a wall switch
* Replace a 2-prong or 3-prong outlet with a GFCI
* Replace a downstream 2-prong with 3-prong

(All things where you can just replace the part, without changing the circuitry)


## Replace a plug end

* Easy!
* Unplug it
* Cut the old one off
* Expose and strip the wires
    * Black: hot (smaller prong)
    * White: neutral (bigger prong)
    * Green or bare: ground
* Underwriter's knot
* Wire it up
    * Be careful of polarity
* Test it


## Replace a lamp socket/switch

* Fix one that's fritzy
    * Could be the wiring or the socket
* Or convert to 3-way, or change the switch
    * Be careful about heat, if using incandescent bulbs
* (Show parts / options)
* Unplug it
* Take off the old one
    * Polarity usually doesn't matter
* Wire in the new one
    * Underwriter's knot
* Test it


## Replace a wall switch

Only if you're replacing like-for-like!

* Shop
    * Quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
    * Remove, replace (unchanged from original)
    * Wrap, reassemble
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test


## Sidebar: grounding "to the box"

* If there's a metal junction box in the wall
    * It should be grounded
        * i.e. you should ensure that it is connected to a ground line
* Lots of places online will tell you to "ground to the box"
    * That's exactly backwards
        * But rooted in a misunderstanding of a case where it might not be backwards


## Replace a 2-prong or 3-prong outlet with a GFCI

* Shop
    * Amperage, depth, tamper, quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
    * Remove, replace
        * Connect "line" and "load" correctly!
            * This may be different from the prior wiring
    * Wrap, reassemble, sticker
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test
    * Then test downstream outlets, too

...then replace downstream 2-prong outlets with 3-prong


## Replace a downstream 2-prong with a 3-prong 

* Like GFCI, but easier
* Shop
    * Amperage, tamper, quality, color, cover (shape, color)
* Prepare
    * Test, disconnect power, test
* Do it
    * Disassemble
        * Make note of how the existing wires are connected
    * Remove, replace (unchanged from original)
    * Wrap, reassemble, sticker
* Validate
    * Reconnect power, test


## Replace a ceiling fan

(Not really - but consider a support bracket)
