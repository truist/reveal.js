# Negotiation
## In 10 minutes or less <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## Qualifications
* Married for 13 years

* Children for 6 years

* I can claim success<sup>*</sup>


## The goal
* Get as much of what you want, as possible

* Without giving up any more than you have to

* Avoid getting screwed


## No, not really


## The real goal
* Get what you are trying to get

* In exchange for what you're willing to give, for it

* Optimize this for yourself, without risking either of the prior things


## This is why I can claim success

I've generally been satisfied with the results of my negotiations


## Negotiating Power

The party who is more-willing to walk away can (and often does) get more of what they want, for less in exchange


## Know when to walk!
* At what point would you be willing to give up on what you want?
    * Some combination of "what you get" and "in exchange for..."

* "I'd rather walk away than give X for Y..."

* This isn't actually a single point; it's a complex space

* If you end up choosing to walk away... you'll be happy with it


## Don't start negotiating until you have a good sense of when you'd walk away!


# NEGOTIATION STRATEGY


## Subtext
What the other party says is often designed to intentionally obscure:

0. Their real goals (what they want)
0. What they're really willing to give
0. Where their walk-away lines are

Stay mindful of trying to figure out those things!


## Negotiating stance
1. From strength
    * I am willing to walk away if I don't get what I need from this

2. From desperation
    * I need this; I'm not willing to walk away


## Only those two?!?
* Yes, I think so

* If you aren't projecting "strength", you are projecting weakness

* The stance you project doesn't have to be the stance you feel... but that increases the risk of a failed negotiation

* The stance you project doesn't have to relate to your relative negotiating power


## Negotiation approaches
1. Open
    * Here's what I want, and here's what I'm willing to give for it
    * Here's what I need; what do you need?

2. Adversarial
    * Carefully inch your way through communicating your needs and limits

Either approach can work with either stance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## If you don't know when you'll walk away, you can't effectively negotiate


## Think about each quadrant
* Adversarial / Strength
    * "Get the best I can out of this, or walk away"
    * This is what most people think "negotiation" is

* Adversarial / Desperation
    * "Win or bust"
    * (Or this is what they think it is)


## Think about each quadrant
* Open / Strength
    * "Give us both the best odds of making this work, or walk away"
    * Vulnerable to being screwed... out of things you don't really need
    * But either way you're happy with the result
        * If you are willing to walk away at the appropriate time

* Open / Desperation
    * "Throw myself on your mercy"


# NEGOTIATION TACTICS


## The need for tactics
* You don't really need "tactics" if your approach is "open"

* But it helps to know them, especially to defend against them
    * Sometimes the other party insists on being adversarial


## It starts before you think it does
* It starts when you set a tone

* With body language, eyes, words, posture, confidence

* Some very-large percentage of it is in how well you project confidence
    * (In most cases)


## Discomfort
* Feelings drive most negotiations, far more than you might wish they do

* The more you can ignore your own discomfort, the better

* The more you can make the other party uncomfortable - without making them angry - the more you get
    * Professional negotiators (HR, lawyers, ...) use this extensively!

* For most of us, making other people uncomfortable makes us uncomfortable
    * So maybe you choose not to use this technique - stick to "open"


## Discomfort (tactics)
* Don't speak first

* Silence / wait

* Ignore your discomfort

* Think about what you'll say to your spouse about what you agreed to

* Be careful about anger


## Push
* Ask for more than you think is reasonable

* Often your gauge is off - it will actually seem reasonable to the other side
    * Or the simple fact that you asked will raise their impression of you!
    * But sometimes being too-far off can be a mistake, so be a bit careful

* Asking for too little is just a missed opportunity

* Sometimes your "too far" is easy for the other party to give

* If the other party wants to say no... they'll be uncomfortable!


## Higher power
* Pretend (or have a) lack of authority to decide

* Makes it harder on the other party to push you

* Gives you a chance to step away and come back


## Get creative
* Sometimes a seeming impass can be resolved by being more open
    * Creative new ways to give what they want
    * Finding new things that you could give that don't cost you much

* The more "open" you are, the more likely you are to find this


## Strike while the iron is hot
* If you forget to work out some detail, it will be much harder to get it later

* Nail down all the details during the first negotiation

* Only reopen negotiations if you'd be willing to walk away from the deal altogether, as it stands


# GOOD LUCK!
