## What this isn't

* Me teaching you
* Me running a session
* Me having a particular outcome in mind


## What this is

* A participant-led activity
* A chance for all of us to learn about something, together
* Multiple somethings!
    * Mob programming
    * The Gilded Rose kata
    * The Driver/Navigators pattern
    * JavaScript


## Mob Programming

> A software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.

[Agile Alliance page](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/)

[In-depth "experience report"](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/)


## Huh? Why?

* Eliminate communication delays
* Reduce misunderstandings
* Shared decision responsibility
* Shared learning
* Stick to only what's strictly necessary
* Prevent technical debt
* Reduce context switching
* Positive effect on individual politics


## Why not?

* Sounds inefficient
* Some people don't like participating
* Germs


## OK, how?

* Driver / Navigators pattern
    * (Based on "strong pairing")

> For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone elseâ€™s hands.

> "I have an idea, you take the keyboard!"

See that experience report above, and [this article](https://medium.com/@maaret.pyhajarvi/the-driver-navigator-in-strong-style-pairing-2df0ecb4f657).


## Specifics

* Switch every N minutes
    * What N, today? 5?
* Driver focuses on one task at a time
* Navigator(s) look ahead
* There's no "right" level of abstraction
* Be courteous (among the navigators, too)
* Mini-retrospective at the end


## OK, what?

* [Gilded Rose kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
    * [In JavaScript](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/js)
    * Using `SpecRunner.html` for unit tests
    * [The Requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)
* Notepad++ as the editor
* Git


# Any questions?


# OK, begin!
